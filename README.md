Hello there, there's a quick readme for this "program".
Discordpp means Discord profile picture.

Steampp means Steam profile picture.

If u want to use that "program" first, open the file you want (if you want discord profile picture then open discordpp etc.) in browser. Then, click upload photo,
and upload photo u want. After that, site will generate ur Profile Picture. Enjoy!
